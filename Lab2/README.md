# Lab 2 - Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template 

## Goal

In this lab you will create an Azure Resource Manager template to provision your Azure resources and configure them automatically.

## Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template ?

Azure Resource Manager allows you to provision your applications using a declarative template. In a single template, you can deploy multiple services along with their dependencies. You use the same template to repeatedly deploy your application during every stage of the application lifecycle.

## The benefits of using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template

Resource Manager provides several benefits:

* You can deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group, rather than handling these resources individually.
* You can **repeatedly** deploy your solution throughout the development lifecycle and **have confidence** your resources are deployed in a consistent state.
* You can manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts.
* You can define the dependencies between resources so they're deployed in the correct order.
* You can apply access control to all services in your resource group because Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is natively integrated into the management platform.
* You can apply tags to resources to logically organize all the resources in your subscription.
* You can clarify your organization's billing by viewing costs for a group of resources sharing the same tag.
* You can see your template as a documentation of your infrastructure.  ( [Infrastructure as a code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/what-is-infrastructure-as-code) )
