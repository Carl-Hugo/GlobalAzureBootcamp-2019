# Lab 2 - Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template 

## Goal

In the previous lab we deploy the web application with a partial CI/CD. Let's now apply a fully automated process and package our application in an ARM template. We will also add a storage account to our resources (for later purpuses), and update the CI/CD to deployusing the new ARM template.

## Let's code!
