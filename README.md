# Global Azure Bootcamp 2019 - Montréal & Ottawa, Canada

![gablogo][gablogo]

All around the world user groups and communities want to learn about Azure and Cloud Computing!

On **April 21, 2019**, all communities will come together once again in the sixth great [Global Azure Bootcamp](https://global.azurebootcamp.net/) event! 

In this repository you will find included all materials used during the demos so you can try them at home.


## Scenario 2019
Life has been going very well at *Contoso* it's been a while since they start their journey on Azure. Things have been so well that today *Contoso* has many developers across the many different locations and using different platforms. 

In an effort to improve their efficiency and the quality of their application they decided to agree on the following:

* Use cross-platform tools as much as possible. 
* Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment solution (CI/CD)
* A way to reproduce the environment quickly in any new environment
* A better integration of tests
* They would like to experiment with Containers
* Artificial Intellegent is an excellent way to bonify their application and distinguish themselves from the competition.
* Get rid of their old process
* 

The team has been assigned a couple of days to find tools & put new processes in place to check all the action items of the list above. Excited, the team will actively start documenting themselves and working on this tomorrow.
