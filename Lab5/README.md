# Lab 5 - Azure Cognitive Services

## Goal

We will add a Azure Cognitive Services Vision to our ARM template. Modify the code of the web application to read one image (provided) from a Azure blob storage, and display the information returned by the Vision API. The image ( a dog or a cat) will be uploaded to the Blob storage using the Azure POrtal or the Azure Storage Explorer.

## Let's code!
